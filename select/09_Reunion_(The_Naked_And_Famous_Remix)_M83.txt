My body is like a lighting rod
Capsize me and douse me in your bay
A shiver of want, always
When you are on the tip of my tongue
In the back of your parked car
I could build a fort
And play all day
Between your lips
Let's stay here forever

Will you stay in this land
Will you stay in this land
Will you stay in this land
Will you stay in this land

My body is like a lighting rod
Capsize me and douse me in your bay
A shiver of want, always
When you are on the tip of my tongue
In the back of your parked car
I could build a fort
And play all day
Between your lips
Let's stay here forever
(Will you stay in this land)

Will you stay in this land
Will you stay in this land
Will you stay in this land
Will you stay in this land

In this land
In this land
In this land
In this land
In this land
In this land
In this land
In this land
